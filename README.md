This project consists of a CHIP-8 emulator implemented in Python. CHIP-8 is a
platform that can run old school games like Pac-Man and Pong. It has 4K memory
consisting of main memory, 16 registers, a stack, two timers, input/output with
graphics and sound, and a font set. Programs written for CHIP-8 implementation
consist of 35 opcodes represented in hexadecimal notation. The op codes manipulate
the memory and registers to let users play their favorite games.


From Wikipedia:

CHIP-8 is an interpreted programming language, developed by Joseph Weisbecker. It was initially used on the COSMAC VIP and Telmac 1800 8-bit microcomputers in the mid-1970s. CHIP-8 programs are run on a CHIP-8 virtual machine. It was made to allow video games to be more easily programmed for these computers.

Roughly fifteen years after CHIP-8 was introduced, derived interpreters appeared for some models of graphing calculators (from the late 1980s onward, these handheld devices in many ways have more computing power than most mid-1970s microcomputers for hobbyists).

An active community of users and developers existed in the late 1970s, beginning with ARESCO's "VIPer" newsletter whose first three issues revealed the machine code behind the CHIP-8 interpreter.[1]
