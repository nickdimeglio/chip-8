CHIP-8 is an interpreted programming language developed by Joseph Weisbecker. An active community of users and developers existed in the late 1970s, beginning with ARESCO's "VIPer" newsletter whose first three issues revealed the machine code behind the CHIP-8 interpreter. Initially used on the COSMAC VIP and Telmac 1800 8-bit microcomputers, the language was desgined to allow video games to be programmed once and then run on an assortment of platforms. 

The CHIP-8 interpreter has 4K memory consisting of main memory, 16 registers, a stack, two timers, input/output with graphics and sound, and a font set. Programs are written for CHIP-8 using a set of 35 hexadecimal opcodes. The op codes manipulate the memory and registers to let users play their favorite games.
